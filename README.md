This is a list of my freeCodeCamp projects. You can also see some of my projects on my main website at riyadargoub.com .

You can run the Replit projects by using the "upload file" button.

For React projects, use the following command on a Node.js terminal in a new folder:

create-react-app ./

then use this command:

start ./

and copy/paste the files from this repository into the folder.
